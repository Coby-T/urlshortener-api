# URL Shortener Microservice
By Coby Tao

As part of [FreeCodeCamp's curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/url-shortener-microservice)

### User Stories
1. I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
2. If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
3. When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.

### Example Usage
